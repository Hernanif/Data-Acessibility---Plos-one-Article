# Data Acessibility - Wing morphology predicts individual niche specialization

Here we provide the values of X and Y coordinates of the anatomical landmarks for the wings of each individual bat together with the network matrices and specialization values (92%, 94%, 96%) of their diet. In addition, we also provide the photos of the wings for each individual bat and the fasta files containing the reads processed as described in the manuscript but with singletons still retained in the file.
